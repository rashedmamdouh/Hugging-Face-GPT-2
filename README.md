
Code Generation
1 Objectives
    1. Use HuggingFace to generate code for NLP tasks.
    2. Understand the basics of code generation and how it can be used in software development.
    3. Apply My knowledge of NLP concepts and techniques to generate code using Hugging￾Face.
2 Problem Statement
    In this Project, I was learning about code generation, which is the process of automatically
    generating code from a set of input data or instructions. Code generation is a useful technique
    for many tasks in software development, including creating boilerplate code, generating code
    from templates, and automating the creation of code based on user input.
    HuggingFace is a popular open-source library for natural language processing (NLP) tasks
    in Python. It provides a wide range of pre-trained NLP models that can be fine-tuned for
    specific tasks, as well as tools for training and deploying NLP models. In this Project, I
    use Hugging Face to generate code for a variety of NLP tasks.
3 Lab Requirements
    Follow Colab Link for code Skeleton. Link
    1. Data
    Dataset contains a collection Python code collected from public repositories such as
    Github and filtered for keywords related to Python Libraries. A Pre-filtered version
    can be downloaded using HuggingFace .
    2. Model
        I required to use a small version of GPT-2 model with the provided configuration.
    3. Resources
        Make sure I used Google Colab GPU along with installing the essential libraries
        using Pip.
4. Experiments
    I required to run at least 3 different experiments and save their weights using
    different configurations of any of the following :
    • Learning Rates
    • Optimizers
    • Gradient Accumulation Steps
    • Number of Max Steps of Training
5. Results
    My results should be in colab and it is best to run a different colab for each experiment
    to save the outputs.
    Prepare a Report Containing the following :
    • GPT-2 and its’ Architecture.
    • for each experiment :
    – Report Perplexity and eval results variable value with each experiment along
    with any plots, score and anything similar.
    – Report the output of the Code Prompts given at the end of the Notebook
